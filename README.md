## motor driver control.ino
uses a IR remote to comunicate with the LM293D drives to move the car `forword`, `backward`, `right`, `left` and `stop`
issue detcted sometimes `FFFFFFFF` is picked up by the IR reciver and everything just stops working and this also stops the code from working if the button is pressed

- [x] Fixed the `FFFFFFFF` thing

## code to remove FFFFFFFF.ino
